#### we have implimented docker concept in this project in order to make docker image .
* for more information kindly check 'Dockerfile' & 'Dockerbuilding.md'
* command for runnng docker image is given in 'Dockerbuilding.md' file ..

 * This is a machine learning model made using python and flask which predicts the price of boston house using Random Forest Regression Algorithm.
 * Do ⭐ the repository, if it helped you in anyway. 

# About the Dataset :

 * A Dataset derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. This dataset contains information collected by the U.S  Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass.
